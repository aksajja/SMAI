A1

Handwritten -
From the graph we can directly indicate the SVs.

Coef(w) and intercept(b)

alpha(i) is non-zero for SVs.


A2

2 classes of 1D from gaussain distributions.
y is {+1,-1}

Linear regression is convex, show convergence on plot.
Log_reg is non-convex, show NON-convergence.

1) Do either of them assume linear separability?
	Linear regression does assume.
	Logistic does NOT.

2) For regression, it should not matter if y is {+1,-1}

A3

How does accuracy change with C?
To check how the decision boundary changes (SVs change) as the softness (C, i.e., tolerance) is varied.

Find top-2 eigen vectors and plot on 2D for a given C.

Indicate the SVs in the above plot.
