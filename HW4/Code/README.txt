Create two classes from two normal distributions.
Parameters used for a normal distribution are mean and covariance matrix.

Cases -
1) Means are random and Cov mat is diagonal
2) Means are random and Cov mat is PSD
2) Means are identical and Cov mats are different.

To Do -

For each case,
    Write the class expressions. P(A) = Normal dist(u,E) & P(B)
    Plot in 2D and 3D

## Generating classes ##

case 1:
Mean is a random 3D vector. CovMat is a 3x3 diagonal matrix.
