Google to understand how many eigen values need to be picked.

The variances in the direction of the eigenvectors are their eigenvalues. Hence, the proportionality gives relative importance.
How many eigenvectors should we choose to project our data on? A rule of thumb is to choose the first n eigenvectors such that the sum of their variances (eigenvalues) is larger than 95% of the total.
